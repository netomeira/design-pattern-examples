Singleton pattern restricts the instantiation of a class and ensures that only one instance of the class exists in the Java virtual machine. It seems to be a very simple design pattern but when it comes to implementation, it comes with a lot of implementation concerns. The implementation of the Singleton pattern has always been a controversial topic among developers. This is one of the most discussed java design patterns.

* Singleton pattern restricts the instantiation of a class and ensures that only one instance of the class exists in the java virtual machine.
* The singleton class must provide a global access point to get the instance of the class.
* Singleton pattern is used for logging, drivers objects, caching and thread pool.
* Singleton design pattern is also used in other design patterns like Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype, Facade etc.
* Singleton design pattern is used in core java classes also, for example java.lang.Runtime, java.awt.Desktop.
